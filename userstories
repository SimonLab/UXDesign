User Stories

Prompts that guide the development of a product
Not a specification, but a communication and collaboration tool — not to be handed off to the development team, but rather be part of the conversation between product owner/manager and team
User stories should be short, fit on a small physical card
“Epic” stories involve looking at the product on a macro scale, and will include a series of micro user stories — starting with epics is good for capturing the full scope of a project, and guide the creation of smaller, more detailed user stories
As a [role], I want [goal/desire], so that [benefit]
Acceptance criteria describes the conditions that have to be fulfilled so that the story is done, making the story testable
Role should not be generalised as a “user”, since there can be many types of user (eg. system administrator vs customer)
